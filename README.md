# Benchmarking Network Cache
##### Alec Kosik and Alex Pan
<br />
#####Disclaimer:
```

Compiled and tested on Mac/Linux (done by adding -gnu=c99 flag to compile on Linux)
Make file will work on Mac/Linux, no need for any changes if testing on either operating system

./server //will run server side
./client //will run client side
```

To clone this repository:
```git clone --recursive https://github.com/apanana/NetworkBenchmarks.git```

Leaving out the recursive flag will make git ignore the submodule jsmn and stunt client compilation.
